<P> Ever had the frustrating experience of not being able to decide where to eat? When Yelp gives you too many choices that you get mired down in the decision-making, Noms is here to help! Noms is a restaurant discovery app that removes the hassle of decision making and never let you worry about restaurant selection again.

<P> <a href="http://nomsapp.herokuapp.com"/> Download Homs here!</a>

<i> Please make this as easy for us as possible.</i>  There are 45 projects and if
we have to blow 15 minutes figuring out how to run your system, that's one very
long day wasted.

<P> These links must point to PDF files <b>with exactly the
specified names</b>.  They must not require logging into some place
like Google Docs or GitHub.  We need to have all submissions in
one place and completely uniform at this level so the TAs and I can
access the pieces easily.

Thanks.
